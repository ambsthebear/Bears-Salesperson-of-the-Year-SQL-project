1. Who was the top salesperson for the year?

Looking at 3 top categories (number of sales, total pieces sold, and total $ amount sold), Abraham Bennet was the top performer in 2 of the 3 categories (number of sales and total pieces sold), so he could be named top salesperson. He had 118 sales that resulted in moving 63035 items.

Michel DeFrance led the 3rd category (total $ amount sold) by selling $101182.42 worth of products, largely due to his relationship with our highest spending customer. He deserves an honorable mention for the trust he's gained with this top customer.

TOTAL NUMBER OF SALES: Abraham Bennet (1) had 118 total sales for the year.
TOTAL PIECES SOLD: Abraham Bennet (1) sold 63035 items
TOTAL $ AMOUNT SOLD: Michel DeFrance (4) brought in $101182.42


2. How much better did the top salesperson do than the individual who came in second for the year?

TOTAL NUMBER OF SALES: Michael O' Leary came in second for total sales with 70 sales. Abraham Bennet did 68.57% better in terms of sales numbers.
TOTAL PIECES SOLD: Ann Dull came in second for total pieces sold with 38647. Abraham Bennet did 63.1% better in terms of quantity of products sold.
TOTAL $ AMOUNT SOLD: Dirk Stringer came in second for total $ amount sold, bringing in $94876.65. Michel DeFrance did 6.65% better in terms of $ amount sold.


3. Was there any relationship between the average sale amount for the top salespersons and the total sales?

Abraham has had 8 customers throughout the year who have placed 8-25 orders with him. The average sale amount varies from $0-$742.35 with an average number of items sold ranging from 35-967, with most customers buying an average of 230+ items. Abraham has a diverse customer base in terms of budget and volume, so the average sale amount doesn't necessarily coincide with his high sales numbers.

Michel has 3 customers, 2 of which are customers who shop at higher price points. These customers are loyal - returning to work with Michel 11-25 times this year. The consistency of orders with these customers shows that he can anticipate their needs and can successfully upsell without disrupting customer trust. Michel also tends to have higher volume sales with fewer customers. His average sales amount vary from $34.99 - $3374.99 with an average number of items sold ranging from 280-717. With fewer customers, average sale amount (both budget and volume) becomes becomes more important to boost the $ amount of sales.


4. How do you think the top selling salesperson gained so many sales? What was their strategy?
- Did they sell to many customers, or a dedicated few?
- Did they tend to sell a few big ticket (high priced) items, or did they focus on a high volume of lower priced items?

Abraham does a great job catering to a variety of customers who keep returning to work with him throughout the year. He recognizes when giving the customer exactly what they need will maintain loyalty - even if that means pointing them to items at a lower price point instead of upselling needlessly. Abraham understands how to foster customer loyalty and diversify the types of customers he's working with regularly.


5. What was the top selling product for the year? What was the lowest selling? (For both dollar amount sold and quantity sold).

TOP NUMBER OF SALES: External Lock Washer 7; Mountain-100 Black, 38; Touring-3000 Blue, 54 tied with 25 sales each
LOWEST NUMBER OF SALES: Fender Set - Mountain had 1 sale

TOP $ SOLD: Mountain-100 Black, 38 with a total of $84374.75 sold
LOWEST $ SOLD: Chainring Bolts, Flat Washer 4, External Lock Washer 7, External Lock Washer 2, Lock Washer 3 tied with a total of $0 sold each

TOP QUANTITY SOLD: Touring-3000 Blue, 54 with 24175 sold
LOWEST QUANTITY SOLD: Chain Stays with 169 items sold

6. What problems did you find in the data? (For example, where there any products without a price?)
The lowest $ sold items all had prices of 0, which didn't make sense unless they were free items added in with orders. Or if the price per piece is less than $0.01, how do we package them in bulk so that we can see a $ amount associated with those items.
